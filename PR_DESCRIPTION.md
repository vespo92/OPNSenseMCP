## Integration Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opnsense": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/opnsense-mcp",
      "env": {
        "OPNSENSE_HOST": "https://192.168.1.1",
        "OPNSENSE_API_KEY": "your_key",
        "OPNSENSE_API_SECRET": "your_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

1. **Home Network Automation** - "Create a guest VLAN with internet-only access"
2. **Security Management** - "Block all social media sites on my network"
3. **Device Discovery** - "Find Kyle's laptop on the network"
4. **Gaming Setup** - "Set up a Minecraft server with proper port forwarding"
5. **Network Monitoring** - "Show me all devices on the IoT network"

## Future Vision
