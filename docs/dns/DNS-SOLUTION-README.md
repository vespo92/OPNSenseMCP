# OPNSense DNS Blocking Solution Summary

## Quick Start

To solve the DNS blocking issue immediately:

```bash
# Run the complete solution
node solve-dns-blocking.js

# Or use the batch file
run-dns-solution.bat
```

## What This Solves

The issue where `block_domain` reports success but domains don't appear in the blocklist. The solution:

1. **Properly formats domains** for Unbound host overrides
2. **Applies configuration changes** with the reconfigure API
3. **Verifies blocks** are actually in place
4. **Blocks both root and www** subdomains

## Files Created

### Solution Scripts
- `solve-dns-blocking.js` - Complete solution that blocks pornhub and other adult sites
- `debug-dns-blocklist.js` - Debugging tool to inspect current DNS configuration
- `run-dns-solution.bat` - Windows batch file to run the solution
- `test-dns-blocks.ps1` - PowerShell script to test if blocks are working

### Documentation
- `DNS-BLOCKING-SOLUTION.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `examples/home-network-iac.js` - Example of how this fits into your IaC vision

### Fixed Implementation
- `src/resources/services/dns/blocklist-fixed.js` - Corrected DNS blocking logic

## How It Works

The solution uses the OPNSense API to:

1. Add host overrides pointing domains to 0.0.0.0
2. Apply Unbound configuration changes
3. Verify the blocks are in place

Example of correct format:
```javascript
// Block pornhub.com
{
  enabled: '1',
  host: '@',              // @ for root domain
  domain: 'pornhub.com',
  server: '0.0.0.0',      // Black hole
  description: 'Adult content block'
}
```

## Testing the Blocks

From Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
.\test-dns-blocks.ps1
```

From any device on the IoT VLAN:
```bash
nslookup pornhub.com
# Should return 0.0.0.0
```

## Integration with Your IaC Vision

This DNS blocking is a building block for your larger Infrastructure as Code goals:

### Current State
- Manual MCP commands to block domains
- Works but requires individual API calls

### Future State (Your Vision)
```javascript
// Pulumi/SST style configuration
const homeNetwork = new NetworkStack({
  dns: {
    policies: {
      iot: { block: ['adult', 'malware', 'ads'] },
      guest: { upstream: 'quad9' },
      kids: { 
        block: ['adult', 'social'], 
        schedule: 'school-hours'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Next Steps for IaC

1. **Create Policy Engine**
   - Define policies in YAML/JSON
   - Apply across multiple MCP servers
   - Track state and changes

2. **Add More MCP Servers**
   - Home Assistant for automations
   - Proxmox for VM management
   - UniFi for network hardware

3. **Implement GitOps**
   - Store configs in Git
   - PR-based changes
   - Automated deployment

4. **Add Monitoring**
   - Track DNS blocks
   - Alert on policy violations
   - Dashboard for visibility

## Troubleshooting

If blocks aren't working:

1. **Check Unbound Service**
   - Must be running
   - DNS Query Forwarding must be DISABLED

2. **Verify in GUI**
   - Services → Unbound DNS → Host Overrides
   - Should see entries pointing to 0.0.0.0

3. **Check DHCP**
   - IoT devices must use OPNsense for DNS
   - Not Google DNS or others

4. **Run Debug Script**
   ```bash
   node debug-dns-blocklist.js
   ```

## Support

For issues or questions about extending this for your IaC vision:
- Check the logs in `debug-dns-blocklist.js` output
- Review `DNS-BLOCKING-SOLUTION.md` for detailed technical info
- The example in `examples/home-network-iac.js` shows the end goal

Your vision of AI-driven infrastructure deployment across your home network is achievable! This DNS blocking solution is one piece of that larger puzzle.
