## âœ… Completed Items

### 1. Resource Base Classes
- [x] Abstract Resource class with validation, state, metadata
- [x] ResourceState enum with proper lifecycle states
- [x] ValidationResult interface with errors and warnings
- [x] Helper utilities for common validations

### 2. Concrete Resources (10 types)
- [x] opnsense:firewall:rule
- [x] opnsense:firewall:alias
- [x] opnsense:network:vlan
- [x] opnsense:network:interface
- [x] opnsense:service:haproxy:backend
- [x] opnsense:service:haproxy:server
- [x] opnsense:service:haproxy:frontend
- [x] opnsense:service:dns:override
- [x] opnsense:service:dhcp:range
- [x] opnsense:service:dhcp:static

### 3. Resource Registry
- [x] Type registration system
- [x] Resource instantiation
- [x] Dependency graph building
- [x] Topological sorting
- [x] Batch validation

### 4. State Management
- [x] Persistent state storage
- [x] Deployment tracking
- [x] Checkpoint creation
- [x] Rollback capability
- [x] Concurrent access protection

### 5. MCP Tools
- [x] validateResources - Validate resource configurations
- [x] planDeployment - Create deployment plans
- [x] applyDeployment - Apply deployment plans (fixed)
- [x] getDeploymentState - Query state
- [x] listResourceTypes - List available types
- [x] describeResourceType - Get type details
- [x] createCheckpoint - Save state
- [x] rollback - Restore state
- [x] **applyResource** - Apply single resource (NEW!)

### 6. Testing
- [x] Unit tests for resources
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] TypeScript compilation
- [x] All tests passing

## ðŸ”§ Final Fixes Applied

1. **Added missing `applyResource` tool** - Can now create/update/delete individual resources
2. **Fixed ResourceExecutor** - Now reconstructs Resource instances from serialized plans
3. **Made executor methods public** - createResource, updateResource, deleteResource

## Success Criteria Status

1. âœ… All current functionality works through resource model
2. âœ… Resources have proper validation
3. âœ… State is tracked and persisted
4. âœ… Dependencies are resolved correctly
5. âœ… API payloads are generated correctly

## Phase 1 is now COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

The resource model is fully functional and ready for Phase 2 enhancements.
