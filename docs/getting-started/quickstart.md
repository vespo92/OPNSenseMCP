# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with OPNSense MCP in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

You should have already:
- [Installed the OPNSense MCP Server](installation.md)
- Configured your `.env` file with API credentials
- Built the project with `npm run build`

## 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Connected to OPNsense at https://192.168.1.1
Server ready for connections
```

### Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`  
**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Linux:** `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opnsense": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/opnsense-mcp",
      "env": {
        "OPNSENSE_HOST": "https://192.168.1.1",
        "OPNSENSE_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "OPNSENSE_API_SECRET": "your_api_secret",
        "OPNSENSE_VERIFY_SSL": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use absolute paths in the `cwd` field. Replace `/absolute/path/to/opnsense-mcp` with your actual path.

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
2. Start Claude Desktop again
3. Look for the üîå icon indicating MCP is connected

### Step 4: Test It Out!

Try these commands in Claude:

```
"Show me all devices on my network"
```

```
"Create a guest network on VLAN 50"
```

```
"Block facebook.com and twitter.com"
```

```
"Find devices that connected in the last hour"
```

## Common First Tasks

### 1. Network Discovery

Ask Claude to help you understand your network:

- "List all VLANs configured on my firewall"
- "Show me the DHCP leases"
- "Find all Apple devices on the network"
- "What devices are currently online?"

### 2. Create a Guest Network

```
"Create a secure guest network on VLAN 20 that:
- Has internet access only
- Cannot reach the main LAN
- Uses DHCP range 192.168.20.100-200"
```

### 3. Block Unwanted Content

```
"Block these categories of websites:
- Social media
- Gambling
- Adult content"
```

### 4. Set Up Port Forwarding

```
"Set up port forwarding for:
- Minecraft server on 192.168.1.100 port 25565
- Web server on 192.168.1.101 ports 80 and 443"
```

## Understanding the Tools

The MCP server provides these main tools to Claude:

### Network Management
- **listVlans** - Show all VLANs
- **createVlan** - Create new VLAN
- **listInterfaces** - Show network interfaces

### Device Discovery
- **listArpTable** - Show ARP entries
- **listDhcpLeases** - Show DHCP leases
- **findDevicesByName** - Search for devices

### Firewall Rules
- **listFirewallRules** - Show current rules
- **createFirewallRule** - Add new rule
- **deleteFirewallRule** - Remove rule

### DNS Filtering
- **blockDomains** - Block specific domains
- **listBlockedDomains** - Show blocked domains
- **unblockDomains** - Remove blocks

## Example Conversations

### Example 1: Finding a Device

**You:** "Is Kyle's laptop online?"

**Claude:** Let me search for Kyle's devices on your network...

I found 2 devices that might be Kyle's:
- **Kyle-MacBook** (Apple device)
  - IP: 192.168.1.45
  - MAC: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
  - Last seen: 2 minutes ago
  - Status: Online ‚úÖ

### Example 2: Network Segmentation

**You:** "I want to isolate my IoT devices from my main network"

**Claude:** I'll help you create a separate network for your IoT devices. Let me:

1. Create a new VLAN for IoT devices
2. Set up firewall rules for isolation
3. Configure DHCP for the new network

Creating VLAN 30 for IoT devices...
‚úÖ VLAN created on interface igc3

Setting up firewall rules...
‚úÖ Rule 1: Allow IoT ‚Üí Internet
‚úÖ Rule 2: Block IoT ‚Üí LAN
‚úÖ Rule 3: Block IoT ‚Üí Management

Your IoT network is now isolated on VLAN 30 (192.168.30.0/24).

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific
- ‚úÖ "Create a VLAN on interface igc3 with tag 50"
- ‚ùå "Make a new network"

### Provide Context
- ‚úÖ "Block social media during work hours 9am-5pm"
- ‚ùå "Block stuff"

### Ask for Confirmation
- "Show me what firewall rules you'll create before applying them"
- "What would happen if I delete this VLAN?"

## Advanced Features

Once comfortable, explore:

- [Infrastructure as Code](../iac/overview.md) - Deploy entire network configs
- [HAProxy Configuration](../guides/haproxy.md) - Load balancing
- [Backup & Restore](../guides/backup-restore.md) - Configuration management
- [Patterns](../../examples/patterns/) - Reusable network templates

## Troubleshooting Quick Start

### Claude doesn't see the MCP server
1. Check the üîå icon in Claude Desktop
2. Verify your config file syntax is valid JSON
3. Ensure the path to opnsense-mcp is absolute
4. Restart Claude Desktop

### Connection errors
1. Test with `npm start` in terminal first
2. Verify OPNsense is reachable
3. Check API credentials in .env
4. See [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting/)

## Next Steps

- Explore [Feature Guides](../guides/) for specific use cases
- Learn about [IaC capabilities](../iac/overview.md)
- Check out [Example Patterns](../../examples/patterns/)
- Read about [Production Deployment](../deployment/production.md)
