# MCP-Based IaC Platform: Executive Summary

## Vision Statement
Create an AI-native Infrastructure as Code platform that uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers as standardized building blocks, enabling natural language infrastructure deployment across any cloud or on-premise system.

## Why This Matters

### Current IaC Limitations
1. **Steep Learning Curve**: Terraform, Pulumi, CDK require deep technical knowledge
2. **Platform Silos**: Different tools for different platforms
3. **Static Definitions**: YAML/HCL files can't adapt to runtime conditions
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Cryptic errors, manual rollback
5. **No Intelligence**: Can't learn from past deployments

### MCP-IaC Solution
1. **Natural Language**: "Deploy a web app with load balancing and SSL"
2. **Unified Interface**: One AI orchestrator for all platforms
3. **Adaptive**: AI adjusts based on current state and conditions
4. **Self-Healing**: Intelligent error recovery and rollback
5. **Learning**: Improves patterns based on successful deployments

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: OPNSense MCP Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Transform basic API wrapper into resource-based IaC tool

**Deliverables**:
- Resource model (Firewall, Network, Services)
- State management
- Validation framework
- Basic CRUD operations

**Success Metrics**:
- All resources properly modeled
- State tracking functional
- 100% API coverage

### Phase 2: Deployment Planning (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Add Terraform-like planning capabilities

**Deliverables**:
- State reader (current infrastructure)
- Diff engine (current vs desired)
- Dependency resolver
- Plan visualization

**Success Metrics**:
- Accurate state detection
- Correct change calculation
- Dependency ordering works

### Phase 3: Execution Engine (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Build robust deployment execution with rollback

**Deliverables**:
- Parallel execution engine
- Progress tracking
- Rollback mechanisms
- Checkpoint system

**Success Metrics**:
- Reliable deployments
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Real-time progress updates

### Phase 4: Multi-MCP Integration (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal**: Enable cross-platform deployments

**Deliverables**:
- Cross-MCP references
- Unified orchestrator
- Deployment patterns
- Policy engine

**Success Metrics**:
- Deploy across 2+ platforms
- Reference resolution works
- Patterns simplify deployment

## Use Cases

### 1. Web Application Deployment
**Natural Language**: "Deploy our customer portal with load balancing, SSL, and auto-scaling"

**AI Actions**:
1. Create isolated network (OPNSense VLAN)
2. Configure firewall rules (OPNSense)
3. Provision servers (AWS EC2)
4. Build container (Docker)
5. Setup load balancer (OPNSense HAProxy)
6. Configure SSL (Let's Encrypt)
7. Setup monitoring (Prometheus)

### 2. Disaster Recovery
**Natural Language**: "Failover the payment system to backup datacenter"

**AI Actions**:
1. Check health of primary
2. Update DNS (OPNSense)
3. Redirect traffic (HAProxy)
4. Scale up backup servers
5. Verify data sync
6. Update monitoring

### 3. Development Environment
**Natural Language**: "Spin up a dev environment for the mobile team"

**AI Actions**:
1. Clone production config
2. Create isolated network
3. Reduce resource sizes
4. Deploy test data
5. Configure access rules
6. Set expiration

## Competitive Advantages
