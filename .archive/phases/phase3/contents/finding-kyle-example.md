# Finding Kyle's Devices - Example Usage

## Once DHCP lease viewing is implemented, here's how we'll find Kyle:

### 1. List all devices on guest network
```
User: "Show me all devices on the guest network"

Claude: Checking DHCP leases for the guest network (VLAN 4)...

Found 8 devices on Guest network:
1. Kyle-MacBook-Pro.local - 192.168.4.125 (Apple)
2. Kyles-iPhone - 192.168.4.88 (Apple)  
3. PS5-Kyle - 192.168.4.55 (Sony)
4. DESKTOP-8HK2J9 - 192.168.4.103 (Dell)
5. android-92ba8f21 - 192.168.4.87 (Samsung)
6. Chromecast-Living - 192.168.4.92 (Google)
7. HP-Printer-Guest - 192.168.4.15 (HP)
8. Unknown - 192.168.4.201 (Unknown manufacturer)

Kyle appears to have 3 devices: MacBook Pro, iPhone, and PlayStation 5.
```

### 2. Search for Kyle specifically
```
User: "Find all devices with 'kyle' in the name"

Claude: Searching for devices with 'kyle' in hostname...

Found 3 devices matching 'kyle':
- Kyle-MacBook-Pro.local - 192.168.4.125 (Guest network)
- Kyles-iPhone - 192.168.4.88 (Guest network)
- PS5-Kyle - 192.168.4.55 (Guest network)
```

### 3. Get details about a specific device
```
User: "Tell me more about Kyle's MacBook"

Claude: Here are the details for Kyle's MacBook:
- Hostname: Kyle-MacBook-Pro.local
- IP Address: 192.168.4.125
- MAC Address: 3c:22:fb:aa:bb:cc
- Manufacturer: Apple Inc.
- Network: Guest (VLAN 4)
- Lease Started: 2025-01-10 14:32:15
- Lease Expires: 2025-01-10 18:32:15
- Status: Active
```

### 4. Reserve an IP for Kyle
```
User: "Reserve IP 192.168.4.50 for Kyle's MacBook"

Claude: I'll create a static DHCP mapping for Kyle's MacBook:
- MAC Address: 3c:22:fb:aa:bb:cc
- Reserved IP: 192.168.4.50
- Hostname: Kyle-MacBook-Pro
- Description: Kyle's MacBook - Reserved IP

âœ… Static mapping created! Kyle's MacBook will always get 192.168.4.50.
```

## Implementation Status

To make this work, we need to:
1. âœ… Add DHCP API methods to client
2. âœ… Create DHCP lease resource class
3. ðŸ”„ Add MCP tools for DHCP queries
4. ðŸ”„ Test with real OPNsense API
5. ðŸ“‹ Add static mapping management

The foundation is ready - we just need to wire up the MCP tools and test!
