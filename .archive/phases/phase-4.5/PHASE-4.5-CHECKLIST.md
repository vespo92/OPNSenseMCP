- [x] Created `src/integration/` for multi-MCP (future)
- [x] Created `src/policies/` for policy engine (future)
- [x] Created `src/utils/` for utilities

## IaC Foundation
- [x] Created base resource class (`src/resources/base.ts`)
- [x] Created resource registry (`src/resources/registry.ts`)
- [x] Created example IaC resource (`src/resources/network/vlan-iac.ts`)
- [x] Created deployment planner (`src/deployment/planner.ts`)
- [x] Created execution engine (`src/execution/engine.ts`)
- [x] Created enhanced index example (`src/index-iac.ts`)

## Documentation
- [x] Created reorganization script (`reorganize-phase45.ps1`)
- [x] Created completion guide (`PHASE-4.5-COMPLETE.md`)
- [x] Created IaC architecture reference (`docs/IaC-ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- [x] Created integration test (`tests/integration/test-iac-components.ts`)

## Next Steps (Your Action Items)

### 1. Run Reorganization
```powershell
cd C:\Users\VinSpo\Desktop\OPNSenseMCP
.\reorganize-phase45.ps1
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install zod
npm install --save-dev rimraf jest @types/jest eslint prettier tsx
```

### 3. Update Configuration Files
- [ ] Update `package.json` with new scripts
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` with state directories
- [ ] Update `.env.example` with IaC settings
- [ ] Update `tsconfig.json` if needed

### 4. Clean Build
```bash
npm run clean
npm run build
```

### 5. Test IaC Components
```bash
npx tsx tests/integration/test-iac-components.ts
```

## Phase 5 Preparation

### Ready for Next Phase:
1. âœ… IaC foundation in place
2. âœ… Resource model defined
3. âœ… Planning engine ready
4. âœ… Execution engine with rollback
5. âœ… Clean project structure

### Phase 5 Goals:
1. Complete resource implementations for all OPNSense types
2. Implement persistent state management
3. Add IaC tools to MCP server
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Build deployment patterns

## Success Metrics
- âœ… Zero conflicts with existing functionality
- âœ… Backward compatible
- âœ… Extensible architecture
- âœ… Clear separation of concerns
- âœ… Ready for multi-MCP integration

## Notes
- All existing functionality preserved
- IaC features are opt-in via environment variables
- Foundation supports future multi-MCP orchestration
- Clean architecture for sustainable growth
