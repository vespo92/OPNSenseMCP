# OPNSense MCP Roadmap Index

## Vision Documents
- [Executive Summary](./EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md) - High-level overview of the MCP-based IaC platform
- [Architecture Overview](./00-ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md) - Technical architecture and design principles
- [Real World Example](./REAL-WORLD-EXAMPLE.md) - E-commerce platform deployment walkthrough

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- [Resource Model Implementation](./01-RESOURCE-MODEL.md)
  - Transform API wrappers to resource-based model
  - Implement validation and state management
  - Create resource registry

### Phase 2: Planning (Weeks 3-4)
- [Deployment Planning & State Management](./02-DEPLOYMENT-PLANNING.md)
  - Build state reader for current infrastructure
  - Create diff engine for changes
  - Implement dependency resolution
  - Generate human-readable plans

### Phase 3: Execution (Weeks 5-6)
- [Execution Engine & Rollback](./03-EXECUTION-ENGINE.md)
  - Build robust execution engine
  - Implement parallel execution
  - Add rollback capabilities
  - Create checkpoint system

### Phase 4: Integration (Weeks 7-8)
- [Multi-MCP Integration & Advanced Patterns](./04-MULTI-MCP-INTEGRATION.md)
  - Enable cross-MCP references
  - Build unified orchestrator
  - Create deployment patterns
  - Implement policy engine

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Start Here**: Read the [Executive Summary](./EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md)
2. **Understand the Architecture**: Review [Architecture Overview](./00-ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md)
3. **See It In Action**: Check out the [Real World Example](./REAL-WORLD-EXAMPLE.md)
4. **Begin Implementation**: Start with [Phase 1](./01-RESOURCE-MODEL.md)

## Key Concepts

### Resource Model
Every infrastructure component (firewall rule, VLAN, load balancer) is modeled as a Resource with:
- Unique identifier
- Type designation
- Properties
- Dependencies
- State tracking

### Deployment Planning
Similar to Terraform, the system:
- Reads current state
- Compares with desired state
- Generates execution plan
- Shows what will change

### Multi-MCP Coordination
The platform coordinates across multiple MCP servers:
- OPNSense for networking/security
- AWS for cloud resources
- Docker for containers
- Kubernetes for orchestration

### Natural Language Interface
Users describe what they want in plain English:
- "Deploy a web app with load balancing"
- "Scale the backend to 10 servers"
- "Enable DDoS protection"

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1**: Resource model complete, state tracking works
- **Phase 2**: Accurate planning, dependency resolution
- **Phase 3**: Reliable execution, automatic rollback
- **Phase 4**: Multi-platform deployments working

## Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation
- **Weeks 3-4**: Planning
- **Weeks 5-6**: Execution
- **Weeks 7-8**: Integration
- **Total**: 8 weeks to production-ready

## Next Steps

1. Review the roadmap documents
2. Set up development environment
3. Start with Phase 1 implementation
4. Test each phase thoroughly
5. Iterate based on feedback

## Questions?

This roadmap is a living document. As you implement each phase, update the documentation with:
- Lessons learned
- API discoveries
- Performance optimizations
- Integration challenges

The goal is to make infrastructure deployment as simple as having a conversation. Let's build the future of IaC together!
